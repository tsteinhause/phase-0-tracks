1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
	
	SELECT * FROM moons;

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).	

	UPDATE moons SET ice="false" WHERE name ="Europa";

3. Display the information in both tables using one query.

	SELECT * FROM moons, planet WHERE moons.moon_id = planet.id;

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

	SELECT moons.name, planet.name FROM moons JOIN planet ON moons.moon_id = planet.id;

5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).	

	DELETE FROM moons WHERE name="Io"

JOINS ======================================================

SELECT (name,ice) FROM moons INNER JOIN planet ON name=name WHERE name="europa"

SELECT (name, disc_by_galileo) FROM moons FULL OUTER JOIN planet ON moons.name=planet.name;
