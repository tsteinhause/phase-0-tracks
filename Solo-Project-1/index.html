<h1>DJ life</h1>
	<p> When I am not spending my time learning about coding, and web development I am usually working on music and Djing. Its what takes up my time on <strong>Thursday-Sunday.</strong> Although I am usually working late into the night, I really enjoy spending my time DJing.

	<p>Here is a picture of the equipment that I am usually using while performing.</p>

<h3>DJ Jazzy Jeff</h3>
	<p>Here is a link to a very famous DJ that has been in the music industry for a very long time. You may not realize that he is actually a DJ and remember him from "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air," with Will Smith</p>

	<p>This is a very professional DJ website and looks that it was done by someone with a lot of HTML knowledge. Although there are many attributes and code that I do not recogonize, there are some that I do recognize such as, the basic HTML formatting, a href linking to other pages, and the "<div>" attribute. This website compared to mine is above and beyond much better, but that could be due to the use of CSS.
